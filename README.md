## 👨‍🎓 About Me

I'm an 18-year-old student deeply passionate about technology, gaming, and continuous learning. My journey in tech began early, and I've completed several technical degrees and a technologist program, giving me a strong foundation in programming and IT systems.

I'm dedicated to becoming a Junior Developer and am actively expanding my skills in Python, JavaScript, backend development, and best practices in clean code and version control. I believe in the power of collaboration and open-source communities to drive innovation and personal growth.
